## Tools

* [CMake 3.19+](https://cmake.org/)
* [Conan 1.57+](https://conan.io/) (Can't use conan v2.x)

## Tools on Windows

* [Visual Studio 2019+](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio needs the `Desktop development with C++` workload with the `C++ Clang tools for Windows` component.

## Sources

```bash
# With HTTPS:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmultiplayer/open.mp

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -A Win32 -T ClangCL
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
