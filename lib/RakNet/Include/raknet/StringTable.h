	/// All string tables must match on all systems - hence you must add all the strings in the same order on all systems.
	/// Furthermore, this must be done before sending packets that use this class, since the strings are ordered for fast lookup.  Adding after that time would mess up all the indices so don't do it.
	/// Don't use this class to write strings which were not previously registered with AddString, since you just waste bandwidth then.  Use StringCompressor instead.
