	/// \brief An easy to use mutex.
	/// 
	/// I wrote this because the version that comes with Windows is too complicated and requires too much code to use.
	/// @remark Previously I used this everywhere, and in fact for a year or two RakNet was totally threadsafe.  While doing profiling, I saw that this function was incredibly slow compared to the blazing performance of everything else, so switched to single producer / consumer everywhere.  Now the user thread of RakNet is not threadsafe, but it's 100X faster than before.
