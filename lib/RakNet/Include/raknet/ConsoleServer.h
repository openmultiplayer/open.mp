	/// ConsoleServer takes one TransportInterface and one or more CommandParserInterface (s)
	/// The TransportInterface will be used to send data between the server and the client.  The connecting client must support the
	/// protocol used by your derivation of TransportInterface . TelnetTransport and RakNetTransport are two such derivations .
	/// When a command is sent by a remote console, it will be processed by your implementations of CommandParserInterface
